    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p> Cachapa is a thin pancake made with ground fresh corn, cheese, and panela (or sugar), 
        cooked in a budare (a clay or iron plate).

        It is then served with queso de mano (Venezuelan fresh cheese) and butter.
    </p>
    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <ul> 
        <li>20 ounces frozen corn kernels (about 4 cups)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon granulated sugar </li>
        <li> 1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li> 8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li> 6 teaspoons unsalted butter, divided </li>

    </ul>
    <h2> Directions</h2>
    <ol> 
        <li> Thaw 20 ounces frozen corn kernels 
            overnight in the refrigerator or according to package directions. Drain well. </li>

        <li> Transfer to a food processor fitted with a blade attachment.
             Add 2 large eggs, 1/2 cup whole milk, 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
             , 2 teaspoons kosher salt, and 1 teaspoon granulated sugar. 
             Process until the mixture is a coarse pur√©e, about 1 minute. 
             Add 1/2 cup all-purpose flour and 1 teaspoon baking powder. 
             Pulse until the flour is incorporated, about 1 minute. Transfer to a medium bowl. </li>
        
             <li>Drain and thinly slice 8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese (about 1/4-inch thick). </li>

             <li> Melt 1 teaspoon of the unsalted butter in a 6-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add 1/2 cup of the batter and smooth the top with the back of a spoon. Cover and cook until the bottom is golden-brown and the top is no longer wet, 4 to 6 minutes. </li>
            
             <li> Uncover and add a few slices of the mozzarella to one half of the cachapa. Fold the other half over the cheese. Cover and cook until the cheese is melted, about 1 minute. Transfer the cachapa to a plate or platter. Repeat cooking the remaining batter, melting 1 teaspoon unsalted butter in the pan before each cachapa. If the butter starts to brown, reduce the heat slightly and wipe the skillet clean between each cachapa. Because these cachapas are extremely tender and custardy, they are best eaten right away. </li>
             
        
    </ol>
