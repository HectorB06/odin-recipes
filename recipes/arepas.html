    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p> Arepa is a corn griddle 
        cake made from pre-cooked cornmeal, 
        it is popular in Colombia and Venezuela, 
        where it is served daily with a variety of 
        toppings to complement them. They were traditionally 
        prepared in a pan known as a budare. However, 
        they can be grilled, fried, or baked as well.
    </p>
    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 cups preecoked corn meal </li>
        <li> 2 1/2 Cups of water</li>
        <li> 1 tsp salt </li>
        <li> tbsp vegetable oil </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Directions </h2>

    <ol> 
        <li> Preheat oven to 410° F.</li>
        <li> Pour the water into a large bowl. Make sure it is room temperature.</li>
        <li> Add the salt. Blend well with a mixer, fork or spatula to make sure it dissolves well.</li>
        <li> While you continue to beat the mixture, slowly add the corn meal—a little bit at a time.</li>
        <li> Once all the flour is added, keep mixing until the corn meal, water and salt are thoroughly blended and dissolved. </li>
        <li> Set aside the masa in its bowl. Let it rest for 5 minutes so that the flour is thoroughly hydrated. This type of corn flour does not have any gluten, so it doesn’t need to be kneaded. The masa should be smooth, firm yet malleable.</li>
        <li> While waiting for the 5 minutes’ rest, heat your budare (or comal, griddle, cast-iron pan or non-stick pan) over medium heat. Coat with a little bit of the oil. </li>
        <li> Fill a small bowl with water to wet your hands to make the arepas.</li>
        <li> Take about 2 Tbsp of the masa in your damp hands. The masa should fit easily in your palm so that it is easy to shape into a small ball.</li>
        <li> Shape the masa of the Arepa</li>
        <li> Place your arepas in batches on the preheated surface of your budare griddle or nonstick pan. Let each side turn golden, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Check them often so that they don’t burn. </li>
        <li> Once they are nicely browned on both sides, place the arepas on a baking sheet in your preheated oven for 10 minutes. They should be somewhat puffy, so that if you tap an arepa lightly on top, it will sound like you are tapping an empty box. </li>
        <li> Serve arepas hot, whether you stuff with them with your choice of fillings or serve solo to accompany your favorite Venezuelan guiso or stew. </li>
    </ol>
